# Multigender game of life
A variant of Game of life with 2 genders

In this version of the game of life, cells can be male (blue), female(red) or empty (black)

These are the simple rules:
- 1. If a cell has exactly one male and one female neighbors, a male child appears.
- 2. If a cell has two males and one female neighbors, a female child appears.
- 3. If a cell has one male and two female neighbors, a male child appears.
- 4. If a cell has two male and two female neighbors, a female child appears.
- 5. Everything else dies of overpopulation or starvation.

With only those rules, a lot of interesting patterns appear, discover and experiment for yourself:
